# Tetris JS

A recreation of the classic video game "Tetris", built primarily in JavaScript. This project was completed as a team week exercise to cap off the Intro to Programming course at [Epicodus](https://www.epicodus.com) in Seattle, WA.

## Installation

This game can be played online, with no additional setup required, at [GitHub.io](http://tfirman.github.io/tetris).

1. Clone this repository.

2. Within the master folder, navigate to the index.html file and open it in your preferred (modern) browser.

3. To explore or edit the project code, open the relevant file/s in your preferred text editor. Any saved changes will be reflected when you refresh or reopen the index.html file within your browser.

## Gameplay

Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle game in which a series of falling blocks must be manipulated so that they neatly fit together in horizontal rows across the game field.

Once the game begins, pieces will begin spawning one at a time from the top of the screen, and slowly falling towards the bottom. You can use the "left" and "right" arrow keys to move the active piece around, and the "down" arrow to cause the piece to drop faster.  The "space bar" will drop the piece all the way to the bottom.

Fill in an entire row, and you'll clear it from the screen... and each time the pieces will drop a bit faster! How long can you last before the falling pieces overwhelm you and fill your board?
